Mail is a single page web application that allows users to send and receive emails. It sits on Django and uses JavaScript at the front end to modify the DOM and display different views and features dynamically for the user. Emails are sent, received and modified using the applicationâ€™s API and items are displayed in the relevant mailbox: Inbox, Sent items, Archive.
